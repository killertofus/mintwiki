# Gaming Guide for Linux Mint 2023 by GDev-Peter

Welcome to the world of gaming on Linux Mint! Whether you're new to Linux or a seasoned user, this unified guide will walk you through the steps to install games on Linux Mint or any Debian-based distribution.

## Introduction

Congratulations on making the switch to Linux! If you're eager to explore gaming on this platform, ensure you follow these steps before diving into game installations on your device.

## Step I - Check Game Availability

### I.A - Utilize [ProtonDB](https://protondb.com)

Head over to protondb.com and search for the game you intend to play. The tag associated with the game will indicate its playability on Linux.

- **NATIVE or PLATINUM:** Smooth installation process.
- **GOLD:** Installable with potential minor issues.
- **SILVER or BRONZE:** Possible installation problems; consult a guide if needed.
- **BROKEN:** Unplayable due to an anti-cheat software issue; consider dual-booting with Windows.

Proceed to the platform-specific installation section if the game is **NATIVE**. For **PLATINUM** or **GOLD**, utilize the Wine tool. If it falls below **GOLD**, also use Wine and refer to common bug-solving methods if necessary. For **BROKEN** games, dual-booting with Windows is the recommended solution.

## Steam

Installing games on Steam is straightforward:

- If the game is NATIVE, proceed with the direct installation.
- For NATIVE games with in-game issues, follow the guide for non-native games.
- If the game is non-native, navigate to game settings > compatibility > force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool.
